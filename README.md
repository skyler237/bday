# Happy Birthday Dad!

Happy Birthday!

Here's a little python puzzle for your birthday. I have a couple of secret messages for you hidden in the text and image in this repository, but it's up to you to find them... 

Hint: I have provided a couple of useful scripts for "decoding" the secret messages. Enjoy! I love you!

PS: You may need to install the python packages for opencv, numpy, and matplotlib. You can use the following commands:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```
